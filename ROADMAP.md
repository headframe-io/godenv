# ROADMAP

The following features will be implemented in the nearest future.

- [ ] The loader must support multiple files as an input.
- [ ] When a scan error occurs, it should return the following info: filename, string number, column number.
- [ ] The loader should support env-substitution. E.g., `${VAR}` should be replaced with its value.
- [ ] The scanner must support more escape-sequences: e.g., `\U` for the UNICODE.
